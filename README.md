2. Answer of the question:
   - Graceful degradation is to make website that is not capable of supporting advanced features work properly and provide core functionality. Service worker is an enhancement or an improvement for those more advanced browsers supporting the feature. If the browser supports our service workers, it can load the used data offline which can improve the performance by not using network service. If the browser does not support service workers, we can still load the data by using network requests, which gracefully support core functionality for those old browsers. So, this is a typical behavior of graceful degradation.
